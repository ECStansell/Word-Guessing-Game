# Word-Guessing-Game
School project to create a word guessing game.

Word Guessing game must be run with the provided wordlist.

Project Prompt:
General Requirements
Remember to comment your code - include your name, date, class, and assignment title.
Provide comments throughout your program to document your code process to document each function and provide structure for your code process. 
Create a greeting/title to your program display output.
Add some special characters or some other exciting formatting to make the game fun (colors, asterisks, etc.)
Your program should ask the player if they wish to play again. 
Create a message after the user ends the game. 
Be creative! Have fun with this. Don't overthink it. 
Your output should be formatted for the best user experience. Watch for typos or misspelled words. Be sure you give enough space for the user to input their guess. Use special characters for line breaks to break up each "turn."
Word lists
You must have wordlists totaling at least 30 words to select from divided into themes or topics that you have identified. For example, say your words are all related to United States state names, city names and world country names.  You might choose to have one list named statelist, one list named citylist and one list named countrylist. Each list might contain 15 words.
Break these themes/topics into whatever works best but be sure to have at least a total of 30 words to work from and at least THREE topics/categories to choose from. 
Your game should randomly choose one of the words in the wordlists. 
Output
The player should be given the option to choose the theme/topic of the wordlist. 
The player should be told how many letters the word contains.
Extra challenge: Include an extra "hint" - this might be particularly useful if your word topics are hard. The hint can be triggered once they have only 2 guesses left. 
The player should be shown a list of the letters that they have guessed already.
Output the correct guesses and location of the letters in the word. For example say the word is banana. The user has guesses the letter A as their first guess. Your output will display something like _ a _ a _ a  so that the player can guess the word. 
Your program should keep score of wins/losses and display them to the player after each round. 
Guesses
The player should be given EIGHT wrong guesses. *Note depending on the complexity of your theme/topic area you may wish to modify the maximum guesses. 
The program should ask for a letter guess. Validate that the player inputs only 1 letter in their guess. Handle other inputs with feedback and a request to try again.
Your program should REMOVE the word they just played from the wordlist so they do not get the same word twice. This is VERY important.
Your program should give feedback to the user based on whether they guessed the word correctly or not. Be sure to output the word to let them know they got the word correct or to inform them of the word that they missed. 
After the round has been completed, ask the user if they would like to play again and be sure to let them choose which category they would like to work with again.
